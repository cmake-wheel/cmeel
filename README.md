Wheel build backend using CMake, to package anything with pip and distribute on PyPI.

Following those relevant PEPs:
- [PEP 427](https://peps.python.org/pep-0427/), The Wheel Binary Package Format 1.0
- [PEP 517](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/), A build-system independent format for source trees
- [PEP 518](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/), Specifying Minimum Build System Requirements for Python Projects
- [PEP 600](https://peps.python.org/pep-0600/), Future ‘manylinux’ Platform Tags for Portable Linux Built Distributions
- [PEP 621](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/), Storing project metadata in pyproject.toml
- [PEP 639](https://peps.python.org/pep-0639/), Improving License Clarity with Better Package Metadata, **DRAFT**

## Basic idea

- Glue between PEP 517 `build_wheel` function and modern CMake standard project configuration / build / test / install
- Install in `${PYTHON_SITELIB}/cmeel.prefix/`
    - As there is a dot, it is not a valid python module name, so no risk of importing anything there by mistake
    - Play well with others, as everything is confined to `${PYTHON_SITELIB}/cmeel.prefix`
    - `${PYTHON_SITELIB}/cmeel.pth` automatically load `${PYTHON_SITELIB}/cmeel.prefix/${PYTHON_SITELIB}`, so python
      packages work out of the box
    - Existing `${PYTHON_SITELIB}/cmeel.prefix` are automatically added to `$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`, so we can build CMake
      packages whose dependencies are provided by other CMake packages installed with cmeel
    - Stuff in `${PYTHON_SITELIB}/cmeel.prefix/bin` is exposed via `cmeel.run:cmeel_run`
