# Publish a cmeel release

A github actions handle the build of the release archives, and push them to PyPI and Github Releases.
To trigger it, we just need to:

1. use poetry to update the version number
2. update the changelog
3. `git commit`
4. `git tag`
5. `git push`
6. `git push --tags`


For this, an helper script is provided:

```bash
./docs/release.sh [patch|minor|major|x.y.z]
```
