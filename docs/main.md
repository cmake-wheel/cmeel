# Build Python Wheels from your CMake project

## Get Started

Cmeel follows [PEP 621](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/), so packaging a CMake project with cmeel to build Wheels
mostly consist of writing a `pyproject.toml` file with corrects `[project]` and `[build-system]` sections, eg.:

```toml
[project]
name = "cmeel-example"
version = "0.2.3"
description = "This is an example project, to show how to use cmeel"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">= 3.8"
license = "BSD-2-Clause"
authors = [{name = "Guilhem Saurel", email = "guilhem.saurel@laas.fr"}]

[project.urls]
homepage = "https://github.com/cmake-wheel/cmeel-example"
repository = "https://github.com/cmake-wheel/cmeel-example.git"
changelog = "https://github.com/cmake-wheel/cmeel-example/CHANGELOG.md"

[build-system]
requires = ["cmeel[build]"]
build-backend = "cmeel.build"
```

## PEP 621 Configuration

Everything required to configure a project is in its `pyproject.toml` file, especially:

- in `[project]` section:
    - `name`
    - `version`
    - `description`
    - `requires-python` (cmeel will set `>=3.8` by default if this is omitted)
- in `[project.urls]` section:
    - `homepage`

### Build System

The `[build-system]` section of `pyproject.toml` is the way to indicate that cmeel is to be used by python standard build tools:
- `requires` must at least contain `"cmeel[build]"`
- `build-backend` must be `"cmeel.build"`

### Dependencies

Cmeel packages can have dependencies on other python packages, cmeel or not. They have to be declared in the standard
`dependencies` key of the `[project]` section as a list of strings.

`cmeel` is automatically added.

### Readme

Built wheels will ship the README file in their metadata. The provided content-type for this file will be detected as:

- markdown if the filename ends with `.md` (case insensitive),
- reStructuredText if it ends with `.rst` (also case insensitive),
- plain text otherwise.

## Cmeel specific Configuration

Cmeel configuration can be provided by:
1. `pyproject.toml` file in cmeel specific keys of the `[build-system]` section
2. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cmeel/cmeel.toml` (if `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is not set, fallback to `~/.config`)
3. environment variables

### Working directories

Cmeel works in `$CMEEL_TEMP_DIR` (default to a temporary directory), which contains a `bld` configure and build
directory, and a `pfx` install directory.

If you want to use build cache, you'll probably need to set this to a fixed location.

### CMake configure step

CMake arguments is a list of strings generated by concatenation of:
1. Cmeel defaults
2. `configure-args` key in the `[build-system]` section of local `pyproject.toml`
3. `configure-args` key in global `cmeel.toml`
4. `configure-args` key in the project section in global `cmeel.toml`

This configuration step is done in the environment defined by:
1. The environment of the calling process
2. If installed cmeel packages are detected, prepend `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` with their installation path

### Test step

This configuration step is done in the environment defined by:
1. The environment of the calling process
2. `CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1`
3. `CTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL=4`

### Patch

Cmeel will automatically apply a `cmeel.patch` provided at the root of the project if it exists.

### Other options in `[build-system]` section of `pyproject.toml`

#### `source`

String providing the main CMake source directory for this project. `"."` by default.

#### `run-tests`

Boolean setting to run tests. `true` by default.


#### `run-tests-after-install`

Boolean setting to run tests after the installation instead of before, if they run. `false` by default.


#### `build-number`

Integer which acts as a tie-breaker if two wheel file names are the same. 0 by default.

#### `test-cmd`

List of string providing the test command and its arguments. `["cmake", "--build", "BUILD_DIR", "-t", "test"]` by
default. `BUILD_DIR` is replaced by the current path to the build directory.
